// (Problem 11) 
// Check this mathematical trick for yourself.
// Take user input for 2 single digit inputs, Take first number and double it, add 5 to the result, 
// multiply the result with 5. Add the second number to the answer, subtract the answer with 4, 
// and subtract the answer again with 21. The answer should come out to be the same two single digit numbers. 
// Note: Perform the whole trick with only one mathematical equation.
